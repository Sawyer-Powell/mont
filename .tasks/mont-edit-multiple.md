title: Need to update how mont edit works
---

Mont edit when passed with -e should allow creation of multiple tasks at once.

I.e. if I edit a task, then add another piece of frontmatter underneath it for creating a new task and editing one,
this should result in an edit and insertion of the task.

Mont edit should also support passing in multiple ids comma separated to do a multiedit
