title: User Quality Assurance
type: gate
---

Looking at the changes you have made for this task, generate a number of commands
the user should run themselves to validate the behavior/quality of your work.

This gate can be unlocked if:
- There are no reasonable commands the user should run to validate the quality of the work
- The user explicitly confirms the commands work as expected

To confirm with the user, use the AskQuestion tool, and ask them point blank if the commands
work as expected. If, and ONLY IF, they explicitly answer yes, can you unlock this gate.
