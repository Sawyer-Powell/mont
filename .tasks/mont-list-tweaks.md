- Jots should show in a separate group in mont list.
- Jots should show organized together under features in mont ready
- Mont ready output should have titles more truncated
- Fix truncation algorithm to not leave trailing space. I.e. don't do "some text ...", instead should be "some text..."
- In mont ready, the color of the id should match the coloration of the task type
