title: Change default behavior of mont claude
---

When invoking mont claude, you have to specify a task id to work on.

I think if you don't define a task id, this has the equivalent behavior to 'mont claude -i' currently

But, you can use the id specifier syntax

Like

mont claude '?'

or

mont claude task-id
