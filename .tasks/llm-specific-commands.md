title: Think through support for a set of llm specific commands

Llms should have access to use mont, but LLMs have different CLI tool requirements
than humans do. Using mont llm ... or a global --llm flag, allows us to structure
command line output to be friendly to LLMs.

We need to brainstorm/plan what this looks like, and a good next step.
