- Remove the vertical spacing between tasks that are not dependent on each other, 
- Add truncation to long titles
- If a bug is ready for work, the entire task text should be red, not just [bug]
- Bugs should be preferred to show up higher in the list
- If an epic is ready for work, the entire epic text should be cyan, not just [epic]

Do an interview with me to confirm details
